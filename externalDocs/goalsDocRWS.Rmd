The main goal of the project is to  develop a prototype able to identify fog situation by analyzing daytime images of traffic monitoring cameras.   
The main effort is to have a algorithm/method that has very good performance (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) in identifying fog conditions for static cameras.  
In parallel to the main effort, research will be performed to apply/modify the algorithm for situations in which the cameras are dynamic i.e., the cameras move resulting in a sudden change of the picture scene.
