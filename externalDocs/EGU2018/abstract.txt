Fog is a meteorological phenomenon that has a considerable impact on human activities especially those activities related to transportation and logistics in the terrestrial, maritime and aviation sectors. Lack of visibility can in the most mild situations cause delays and economic damages and in the worst cases bring to loss of lives.
Modern technologies and distributed sensing capabilities can help in visibility inspection. Visibility sensors are an exceptional solution, but their costs limit a country-wide coverage. Remote cameras and visual landmarks at known distances are another solution in which a human operator can judge the conditions of visibility from a remote location. However, this last approach requires a constant monitoring by operators and there are clear limitations to the number of sites that can be concurrently supervised given the labor intensity of the work and therefore the costs.
In order to make best use of the surveillance cameras already in place to monitor infrastructures such as highways, airports and waterways, we have developed an automated system that can automatically recognize fog conditions (i.e., visibility lower than 250 meters) in daylight. In order to be able to successfully recognize fog conditions from many different sceneries (our network of monitoring cameras consists of more than 160 cameras spread across the Netherlands providing pictures every 10 minutes) we have employed a deep neural network . Deep neural network have proven to be good in adapting to the changing scenery in which cameras can zoom in and out and turn suddenly, thus changing the objects in focus. We have trained a 5-layers networks with a (balanced) set of foggy and non- foggy images totaling 9000 images and we have tested the neural network model on a unseen (unbalanced) dataset consisting of more than 5000 pictures. The results are promising showing a precision of 0.8739 and recall 0.9482 and a balanced accuracy score of 0.9417. 
Our current efforts are in improving the performance of the model even more by collecting a larger training and test set, furthermore we are committed to bring the developed fog detection system closer to operational duties for fog monitoring and alert along Dutch highways.
