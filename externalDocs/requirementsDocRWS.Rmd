Below a set of requirements is defined to select the appropriate cameras in term of location, picture properties, and sampling period.

#### KNMI requirement list:

* We are interested in the the following areas, either because of the risk of
  fog is relatively high (e.g. Deelen) or because the area has a double use
  (e.g. Eindhoven).:
    + Schiphol
    + Muiden
    + Houten (if there are fixed cameras)
    + Eelde
    + Woensdrecht 
    + Voorschoten
    + Deelen
    + Rotterdam
    + Eindhoven
  For each area we would like to have 10-15 different pictures, if possible.

* Pictures of at least 320x240 pixels
* Highly preferred: NO labels written in the pictures (e.g., labels of time or camera ID)
* Camera categories of interest:
    + belonging to Gladheid Meld Systeem
    + static (preferred)
    + dynamic (ideally close to the location of a static camera for comparison) 
    
* Location (latitude and longitude) and id (unique identifier of the camera)

* If available view direction or view angle

* Sampling period: 1 minute (preferred) to 10 minutes

* Highly preferred: filename convention as cameraID_YYYYMMDD_HHmm.jpg  
    + cameraID should NOT contain underscore "_"  
    + YYYYMMDD_HHmm are YYYY=Year MM=Month DD=Day HH=Hour(24hour format) mm=minute
