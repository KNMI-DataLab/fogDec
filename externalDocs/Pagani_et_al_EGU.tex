\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document shows the standard for making KNMI-style posters using \latex. It contains three columns in which the user can type the body text and insert figures and equations. The fonts, styles, sizes, paragraphs, etc, are all fixed according to the definitions of the studio, so please leave them unaffected! Some tips about how to use this file effectively are given. %Furthermore, it is shown how to generate a pdf file which can easily be handled by the studio for printing.
\end{abstract}

\bcols %% Start columns

\section*{Motivation}
This is Version \fileversion of the KNMI-style poster made in \latex. This example poster describes how the poster is made up and gives some details about how to insert pictures, work with columns and (the lack of) floats.
Using the Rijksoverheid fonts requires \textbf{compiling with XeLaTeX} typesetting.

\vspace{20pt plus 10pt minus 5pt}
\begin{minipage}[b]{\columnwidth}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{Accident}
	\captionof{figure}{Imaginary part of the refractive index of ice and water as a function of wavelength.}
	\label{figAccident}
	\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-1em}

\section*{Approach}
\subsection*{General}
This standard poster is made of three columns for portrait and four in landscape. Column width and separation distances are 220mm and 20mm for portrait and 245mm and 22mm for landscape. Columns are simply started with \verb|\bcol| and ended with \verb|\ecol|. Ending and restarting within the page is no problem!
Just keep in mind that within the document environment almost all \latex stuff is possible.

\subsection*{Sections and subsections}
Sections and subsections can be used both with numbering (e.g., \verb|\section|) or without numbering (e.g.,\verb|\section*|).

\subsection*{Typesetting}
Font and typesetting are included in the package for A0 posters. Just make use of the default \latex commands. Need to change the text-size?
{\tiny tiny}, 
{\scriptsize scriptsize}, 
{\footnotesize footnotesize}, 
{\small small}, 
{\normalsize normalsize}, 
{\large large}, 
{\Large Large}, 
{\LARGE LARGE},
{\huge huge}, 
{\Huge Huge}.
Or set other styles like \textit{italic}, \textbf{bold}, \underline{underline}, \textsc{small caps}.

% 	\begin{center}
% 	\includegraphics[width=\twocolwidth]{fig3}
% 	\captionof{figure}{A figure spanning two columns.}
% 	\label{2col-fig}
% 	\end{center}
% \end{minipage}

\columnbreak % force jump to next column

\section*{Results}
Figures and tables need to be placed within a \verb|minipage| environment to keep all elements together and enable easy positioning.
However, leave out the default \latex wrapper environments \verb|figure| and \verb|table| as floats are messed up in the column environment.

\subsection*{Figures}

Preferred figure formats are vectors (e.g., PDF or EPS) for proper color handling (cmyk) and scaling when printing. It is best to size the figure by relative scaling with respect to the column width, e.g., \verb|width=1.0\columnwidth|.
Captions are added to figures by appending \verb|\captionof{figure}{...}| after the \verb|\includegraphics| line. Figures \ref{fig1} shows an example.

\subsection*{Tables}
Table \ref{table} demonstrates how tables can be added within a columns, or even spanning multiple ones. It only uses the \verb|tabular| environment. A caption can be added using \verb|\captionof{table}{...}|. 

\subsection*{Multi column figures and tables}
It is possible to make a figure and tables span multiple columns. If you need it as wide as the entire page, just place it outside the \verb|\bcols| and \verb|\ecols| commands. Need the full-page figure in the middle of the page? Just make \verb|\bcols| and \verb|\ecols| environments before and after it!

% \begin{minipage}[b]{\columnwidth}

% 	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{fig1}
% 	\captionof{figure}{Imaginary part of the refractive index of ice and water as a function of wavelength.}
% 	\label{fig1}
% 	\end{center}
% \end{minipage}
\vspace{-1em}

Figure \ref{2col-fig} shows a two column figure. By making the \verb|minipage| two column wide, you extend the area to next column. However, floating and text overflow are not automated, so it is up to you to add a \verb|\columnbreak| and an empty \verb|minipage|.

\section*{Equations}
Ow yeah, just add equations like we are used to it! \verb|amsmath| and \verb|amssymb| are already included.
Equation \ref{eq:example} gives an example of a formula, the acoustic-wave equation in a moving atmosphere,
\begin{equation}
	c^{2}\nabla^{2} \varphi - \left( \partial_{t} + \bold{w} \cdot \nabla \right)^{2} \varphi = 0
\label{eq:example}
\end{equation}
The math font inhere is different from the default \tex font to better match the Rijksoverheid sans and serif fonts.

\section*{Follow up - Open Questions?}
The compiled \latex document directly generates an A0 pdf. However, you do can directly print it out on a scaled paper format, for example, A4 or A3, using one of the colour printers.
To have the poster printed on full size (4 times A4, or A0) by the studio, is only a matter of providing them your compiled pdf.

\section*{Conclusion}
This standard poster offers the possibility of using \latex for making a KNMI-style poster. The procedure is simple because the layout of the poster is contained within this document. It is suggested not to change the layout, but you are free to tweak the \latex code within the defined page area to fit your needs. Bugs and questions related to this \latex style package?
