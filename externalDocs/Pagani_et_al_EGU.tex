\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Visibility is traditionally measured manually by meteorological observers using landmarks at known distances in
the vicinity of the observation site. 
%Nowadays, distributed cameras facilitate inspection of more locations from one
%remote monitoring center. The main idea is, however, still deriving the visibility or presence of fog by an operator
%judging the scenery and the presence of landmarks. 
Visibility sensors are also used, but they are rather costly and
require regular maintenance. Moreover, observers, and in particular sensors, give only visibility information that is
representative for a limited area. 
Cameras are more and more deployed for surveillance and security reasons in cities and for monitoring traffic along
main transportation ways. In addition to this primary use of cameras, we consider cameras as potential sensors to
automatically identify low visibility conditions. 
The approach that we follow is to use machine learning techniques
to determine the presence of fog and/or to make an estimation of the visibility. 
%For that purpose a set of features
%are extracted from the camera images such as the number of edges, brightness, transmission of the image dark
%channel, fractal dimension. In addition to these image features, we also consider meteorological variables such
%as wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and dew point as additional features to feed the machine learning
%model. %Furthermore, it is shown how to generate a pdf file which can easily be handled by the studio for printing.

\section*{Motivation}
Fog and reduced visibility have considerable impact on the performance of road, maritime, and aeronautical transportation
networks. The impact ranges from minor delays to more serious congestions or unavailability of the
infrastructure and can even lead to damage or loss of lives~\cite{gultepe2007fog}.

\subsection*{Key facts:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item May form and dissipate suddenly.
  \item Often only a local phenomenon.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why current technology is not enough:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Satellites are not constantly observing areas of interest.
\item Weather stations observe a limited area.
\item Forecast of fog conditions is complex.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Idea:}
Use camera deployed for surveillance and security reasons in cities and for monitoring traffic along
main transportation ways as potential sensors to
automatically identify low visibility conditions.

\section*{Approach}
\subsection*{From Pictures to Machine Learning}
Pictures are translated to a set of quantities capturing their properties (\textbf{features}).\newline
The meteorological transmissionmeter sensor provide ground truth for the visibility conditions in the measurement field (\textbf{supervised} problem).
\textit{Restrictions}: i) static cameras, ii) daylight conditions, iii) period: 3/2015 - present.

\subsection*{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Image based:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Mean Edges: for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in the image (e.g., foreground and background elements).}
\item{Mean Brightness: perception of a source of radiating/reflecting light.}
\item{Mean Saturation: is a measure of the purity of the color. The purest (most saturated) color is achieved by using just one wavelength, less pure come from a combination at different wavelegths.}
\item{Mean HUE: perception of a source of being similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them.}
\item{Fractal Dimension: self similarity in filling space.}
\item{Transmission smoothness: transmission of the darkchannel of the image (smoothed indicator).}
\item{Transmission changepoint: horizontal point where the transmission of the dark channel is subject to change.}
\end{itemize}
\item{Weather info:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Wind speed}
\item{Dew point}
\item{Humidity}
\item{Precipitation amount}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sections and subsections}
Sections and subsections can be used both with numbering (e.g., \verb|\section|) or without numbering (e.g.,\verb|\section*|).

\subsection*{Typesetting}
Font and typesetting are included in the package for A0 posters. Just make use of the default \latex commands. Need to change the text-size?
{\tiny tiny}, 
{\scriptsize scriptsize}, 
{\footnotesize footnotesize}, 
{\small small}, 
{\normalsize normalsize}, 
{\large large}, 
{\Large Large}, 
{\LARGE LARGE},
{\huge huge}, 
{\Huge Huge}.
Or set other styles like \textit{italic}, \textbf{bold}, \underline{underline}, \textsc{small caps}.

\section*{Results}
Figures and tables need to be placed within a \verb|minipage| environment to keep all elements together and enable easy positioning.
However, leave out the default \latex wrapper environments \verb|figure| and \verb|table| as floats are messed up in the column environment.




\section*{Follow up - Open Questions?}
The compiled \latex document directly generates an A0 pdf. However, you do can directly print it out on a scaled paper format, for example, A4 or A3, using one of the colour printers.
To have the poster printed on full size (4 times A4, or A0) by the studio, is only a matter of providing them your compiled pdf.
